# DOF Bokeh shader 
Unity HLSL implementation of a Depth of field shader with Bokeh effects integrated with URP pipeline. Users can customize the shape of bokehs currently limited to regular polygons, rotate and resize them.
Main code under `Assets/URP/Shader` and `Assets/URP/Runtime/Bokeh`. Work remains to be done to polish the effect and make the DOF CoC calculation simulate real life lens physics.
